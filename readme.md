# My dotfiles

### installation instructions

1. If this is a new machine run zsh-bootstrap.sh then bootstrap-brew-emacs.sh
    - This will install oh my zsh and several plugins used in my `.zshrc`
    - The second script will install all the packages in the `Brewfile` and then install doom emacs.
        - This step will take a while
2. Run the `link-dots.sh` script to simlink the dotfiles
